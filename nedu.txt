[1/2/23, 10:44:42 AM] Chindeu Enenta: It was two weeks until Christmas break; the tone had been set for the holiday festivities. My friends and I talked about all the fun stuff we would do the following week when the counselor summoned me. “Gather four students; we are going to Hopeville,” he said. This visitation was only reserved for prestigious students; I was honored. After that, I knew I would regularly visit Hopeville Community Hospital, Uturu.



It was a difficult period for the people of Uturu. They lost a lot of elderly people, most especially the reverend brothers. There was a Cholera outbreak among the children too. A rural area with a lot of setbacks that did nothing to aid their predicament. Schooling a few miles away from their community made me connected in a way. They needed help, and I was more than ready to offer it.



To me, rendering services is not a big deal, but the problem this time was that I had not visited a hospital for a  long time, so I did not know what to expect. Fortunately, the hospital staff welcomed and guided us on what to do. Despite the pain and sorrow among the patients, my crew and I were ready to help and be of good use to everyone there.



Helping to move dead bodies to the morgue was the scariest part. Seeing and touching the bodies is not what made it difficult. The silence in the morgue and the rules to follow are what weighed heavily. We could only enter with our back facing the entrance and must leave that way. Also, we were required to wash our hands for hygiene and spiritual implication. This experience humbled me, made me introspective about the delicate balance of life, and made me eager to turn to the elders to cherish their time here.



Caring for the elderly was the work I cherished the most. It meant a lot to me. I had the opportunity to listen to their wise words, hear their stories, and generally keep them company. I am positive that someone will do the same for me in the future.







My experience working at a community hospital has taught me to be caring to people around me. The efforts my friends and I had put into aiding the patients of Hopeville had changed us for the better, and I made a promise to visit them ever since.

[1/2/23, 11:07:41 AM] Gozie onyia: I have a very unique sense of humor. I love to turn very mundane things into jokes or tie and humor to make things easier to digest in life. I use this skill a lot with my tutoring students. I have found that my kids are able to grasp information much easier when I tie in some sort of joke what kids are able to learn more freely because they feel that they can relate with me and I know that through my jokes, I can relay better with them. This carries over into many other aspects of my life, and I think that is very important to include a sense of humor.

[1/3/23, 1:57:31 PM] Chindeu Enenta: Sitting at my desk surrounded by textbooks and notes, I felt satisfied knowing I could help my classmates understand complex math concepts. When our teacher asked for volunteers to lead review sessions, I eagerly raised my hand and took on the task. However, as I led the sessions, many classmates struggled to follow my explanations. Determined to help them succeed, I broke down the concepts and used various methods to illustrate the ideas.



Despite my efforts, one of my classmates, Patrick, disagreed with my solution and asked me to explain my answer differently. At first, I felt defensive, but then I realized Patrick didn’t understand the question from my point of view. I needed to find a way to express the solution so he could grasp it. This experience taught me the importance of being open to different perspectives to learn and grow. From then on, I listened to my classmates and incorporated their ideas into my teaching, leading to a more well-rounded understanding of the material.



Overall, this experience was challenging but rewarding. It exemplifies the importance of being open to different perspectives and approaches to learning and growing. I believe that this openness and willingness to learn from others is a valuable trait to have, and it is something that I hope to continue to cultivate throughout my academic and personal life. I am excited about the opportunity to take advantage of Brown University's Open Curriculum, which encourages students to explore broadly, engage with diverse perspectives and challenge themselves to learn from others and think outside the box.

[1/3/23, 5:34:05 PM] Chindeu Enenta: As a student with an intense passion for mathematics, I have always been driven to explore the boundaries of what we understand about this fascinating subject. I remember when I first fell in love with maths. I was in my second year of junior high school. My math teacher, Mr. Eya, had a way of making the subject feel alive and exciting. He would often bring real-world examples to illustrate the concept we were learning and challenge us to think outside the box. There is one particularly memorable lesson where he asked us to calculate the volume of a complex 3D shape using only a ruler and a piece of paper. At first, I was intimidated by the problem, but as I worked through it, I began to see the beauty of math. The feeling of satisfaction that came from solving that problem is something that has stayed with me to this day.



Outside the classroom, I have also been involved in various math-related activities, such as attending math camps and participating in math clubs. These experiences have allowed me to connect with other students who share my passion for mathematics and have allowed me to learn from some of the top mathematicians in the field.



As I look forward to my college experience at Johns Hopkins, I am excited about the opportunity to be a part of the Ex Numera Mathematics Club. I believe these programs will give me the experience and support to push the limit of human understanding in mathematics. I am also eager to learn from and collaborate with other talented mathematicians at the university, as this will be an essential part of my goal to grow as a mathematician. 



My passion for mathematics has shaped my desire to pursue a college education at Johns Hopkins. I believe that the university’s rigorous academic programs and substantial research opportunities will provide me with the tools I need to achieve my goals and make meaningful contributions to the field of mathematics within the Johns Hopkins community and beyond.

[12/22/23, 7:43:00 PM] Gozie onyia: As a top career prep counselor, I'd emphasize that a compelling cover letter should include the following key aspects:

1. **Tailored Content:** Customize the letter for each job application. Address the specific company and role.

2. **Introduction:** Begin with a strong opening statement that grabs attention and clearly states your purpose.

3. **Relevant Skills and Experiences:** Highlight your skills and experiences that directly align with the job requirements.

4. **Enthusiasm and Fit:** Show genuine enthusiasm for the role and the company. Explain why you're a good fit.

5. **Accomplishments with Impact:** Use specific examples of your accomplishments, preferably quantified, to demonstrate your capability.

6. **Conciseness and Clarity:** Keep it concise and to the point. Avoid overly complex language.

7. **Professional Tone:** Maintain a professional and respectful tone throughout.

8. **Closing Statement:** Conclude with a strong closing statement, expressing your eagerness to discuss your application further.

9. **Contact Information:** Ensure your contact information is easily accessible.

10. **Proofreading:** Thoroughly proofread for any grammatical or typographical errors.

Remember, a cover letter is your opportunity to make a compelling case for why you're the best candidate for the job, so make every word count.

[1/1/24, 4:33:44 PM] Gozie onyia: Too easy
[1/1/24, 4:33:53 PM] Gozie onyia: How did you find that solution?
[1/1/24, 4:35:43 PM] Gozie onyia: I think the next thing to search for is the runtime of multiplying a list with the * operator. Your interviewer will ask you to explain the runtime of your solution. It’s good to know both solutions. There’s a chance that if you go into the interview and solve the question in 1 minute they will just give you another harder question
[1/1/24, 4:36:01 PM] Gozie onyia: So take time to explain your thought process
[1/1/24, 6:29:33 PM] Chindeu Enenta: Damn
[1/1/24, 6:29:42 PM] Chindeu Enenta: I was thinking so hard
[1/1/24, 6:29:55 PM] Chindeu Enenta: To get a simple solution
[1/1/24, 6:30:10 PM] Chindeu Enenta: Hell no
[1/2/24, 2:03:36 AM] Chindeu Enenta: I told you that they want a second list
[1/2/24, 2:03:49 AM] Chindeu Enenta: So I used a get function
[1/2/24, 2:03:56 AM] Chindeu Enenta: No mutation
[1/2/24, 2:04:37 AM] Gozie onyia: I don’t get you
[1/2/24, 2:05:42 AM] Chindeu Enenta: This is the list [5, 7, 8]
[1/2/24, 2:05:54 AM] Chindeu Enenta: They want this output
[1/2/24, 2:06:11 AM] Chindeu Enenta: [5,7,8,5,7,8]
[1/2/24, 2:06:31 AM] Chindeu Enenta: Do this times 2
[1/2/24, 2:06:47 AM] Chindeu Enenta: Ìt will get this
